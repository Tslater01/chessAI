# Chess AI: C# Bot Submission for Sebastian Lague Coding Competition
This GitHub repository showcases my submission for the Chess AI Challenge, a C# bot with restrictive programmatic limitations.

## Project Overview:
My **Chess AI** bot is developed in C#. The bot is tailored to challenge and defeat human opponents on lichess.com, adhering to strict performance and resource constraints.

### Key Features of My Bot:
- **ELO Rating Performance**: Demonstrates high accuracy against players rated 500-1500 ELO and maintains a strong win rate against players in the 1500-2000 ELO bracket.
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Operates under a 1024 token code limit, no parallel processing, and capped memory usage.

### Technical Details:
- **Development Frameworks**: Built in C#, integrated with Tensorflow for machine learning aspects.
- **Performance Constraints**: Complies with a stringent 1024 token code limit, avoids parallel processing, and manages within a limited memory footprint.
- **Deployment Strategies**: Leverages Docker and Kubernetes for reliable and scalable deployment.

## Bot's Strategy and Capabilities
- **Adaptive Play**: My bot dynamically adjusts its strategies based on the opponent's playstyle, aiming to counter various tactics effectively.
- **Resource Management**: Despite the restricted environment, the bot maximizes its performance by efficiently using memory and processing power.
- **AI-Powered Decisions**: Integrates machine learning algorithms to predict and counter opponent moves, enhancing its competitive edge

## Development Process
1. **Environment Setup**: Utilized Visual Studio and .NET 6.0 for development.
2. **Coding and Testing**: Extensively coded and tested in the `MyBot.cs` file, ensuring adherence to challenge rules and performance criteria.
3. **Performance Tuning**: Focused on optimizing the bot for various ELO ranges, ensuring robust performance across different levels of gameplay.

## Challenge Compliance
- **Submission Criteria**: Met all challenge rules, including code constraints, memory and time limits.
- **Bot Brain Capacity**: Ensured the bot's code stayed within the 1024 token limit.

## Current Status
- **ELO Performance Testing**: Actively testing the bot against different ELO-rated players on lichess.com.
- **Ongoing Improvements**: Continuously refining strategies and algorithms for enhanced performance.

## Notes
- **Project Duration**: Jun 2023 â€“ Present
- **Repository Link**: [(https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)
- **Accomplishments**: Successfully developed a competitive chess bot demonstrating high accuracy and strategic depth against a wide range of ELO ratings.
